        player is able to pass through the crack


Needed from executor
    When I attempted to make the player pass through the crack, he actually wasn't going through. 
    But the main issue is that the raycaster keeps going and it does not know when to stop because 
    there is no wall along the crack. So, probably the dda enters an infinte loop since there technically 
    is no end to the map in that case. So maybe, you can try to put a cap on the size of the ray line so 
    that if it reaches a certain limit, it stops so that the dda algorithm doesn't segfault at function 
    raycast_custom_angle in line raycasting.c:103


submission notes:
- remove fsanitize and stuff
- why is cleanup_and_exit exiting with 1
